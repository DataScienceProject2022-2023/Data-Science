              <p>The map below illustrates the percentage of electricity each country has generated from renewable sources in the last 26 years.

                By the use of the slider for all years, it is visually clear to see a gradual positive change in a high proportion of renewable sources being used.
                
                It is interesting to see Nepal's 100% rate with Norway, Iceland and the Democratic Republic of the Congo as key contenders. India, surprisingly saw a drop from 27% in 1985 to 19% in 2021. This may be due to prioritising fossil fuel to help faster economic development.</p>

              <h2>CO2 Emissions by G20 Countries</h2>
              <p>
                Conversely, this chart provides an annual overview of the carbon footprint per capita from the G20 nations over the last 3 decades.
                By the use of the line chart for each nation on one canvas, it is easier to identify trends in CO2 emissions.
                More economically developed countries have falling rates of CO2 emissions in comparison to economically developing countries such as India, China and Turkey</p>

                The regression coefficient is 0.79, which indicates strong correlation between higher death rates at higher pollution levels.</p></div>
