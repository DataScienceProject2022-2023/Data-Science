              <h1>An Investigation into  World Poverty and Inequality :  </h1>
              <p>Global inequality and poverty are complex issues that affect individuals and societies across the world. They are the result of a variety of factors, including economic, political, and social systems, as well as historical and cultural factors.</p>
              <p>This project explores the recent trends, examining the relationships between key indicators to better further our understanding of what needs to change for a more equal world.
                </p>
                <h2>Chart 1 - World Inequality </h2>
              <p>The map below illustrates Worldwide GINI coefficient for the past 34 years. 
                
                Through implementation of a slider, it allows the initial lack of information on some countries to be supplemented through scrolling at historical values. 
                            <p>
                One country I found of note to look at was Brazil, who's GINI stayed at 50% between the first year and last, indicating not much overall development has happened with them being stuck in relative poverty.
                
                Another interesting thing was the USA, which hovered at a GINI of 40% for the past thirty years. This could indicate that wealth distribution must not be very equal. </p>

              <h2>Chart 2 - Are GDP and Literacy Rate correlated?  </h2>
              
              <p>
               This chart looks at the relationship between the GDP per capita and Literacy Rate of poorer countries. I have set a maximum value of $22,000, as I want to focus on LEDCs and have a better readable graph.
               <p>
               By using a Population size legend, I can show larger countries more prominently.
               <p>
            My regression value of 0.29 indicates some correlation, however not an extremely strong one. I believe this can be explained to outliers such as China which has a GDP per capita of 13000 and a Literacy Rate of 0.97.  </p>

              <h2>Chart 3 -Is there a Poverty Trap? </h2>
              <p>This chart looks at whether countries that have historically low GDP per capita are able to improve their situation. Something notable is Ireland that started with a relatively low GDP but managed to grow into a rich country</p> 
             <p> We can see that countries that have historically high GDP relative, to begin with, will generally make more GDP per annum. However, countries that have historically low GDPs such as Uganda will remain around the same, indicating that the standard of living in the country has still not increased significantly.

              <h2>Chart 4 - The Relationship between Human Development Index and Gender Inequality</h2>
              <p>I used a scatter plot to see the correlation between these variables clearly : </p>

            <p>By using socio-economic indicators, such as HDI & GII, it is possible to see a close relationship between the two figures for the dataset. With this line of bests fit regression evenly through, we can sese a clear correlation between the two as a higher developed countries have less gender inequality. </p>
                  

                
             <p>   It is interesting to see Switzerland at 0.018GII and 0.962HDI, by leading on both Indexes it shows how inequality is more present the less developed the country is.</p>

              <h2>Chart 5 -What's the relationship between Health Expenditure and Life Expectancy?</h2>
              <p>

                I scraped this data on WorldBank, into a TIDY form, and merged HealthExpenditure&LifeExpectancy to have one dataframe with both variabless to easily input into Python. I was quite intrigued by correlation being almost nonexistant between the two variables at first glance, so I used a slider to look acrosss more dates to see if this was an anomaly. 
                <p>Sadly, it does seem the correlation is very low, this could be because the effects of health expenditure on improving life standards has a time lag, and hence it could be more observed with a constant policy over a periods.</p>

              <h2>Chart 6/7 -Comparing the differences poverty between countries.</h2>
              <p>I scraped Wikipedia API to find the percentage of people per country below minimum living standards, based on the maximum daily consumption available to a person.               
                Something interesting to note is how, poorer countries are more clustered evenly throughout in their poverty lines, whereas India has an abnormally high ratio of the worsts poverty line.
                
                When looking at my other graph attached here, you can clearly see how Africa/India/LatinAmerica have such a small a small share of World Wealth.</p>

    <p>The chart below shows the GDP of China compared to the USA over 60 years.

    <p>  China’s GDP rose from 50 billion to 2 trillion, with the gap between US and China slowly closing.
    
  <p>What this shows us is how a country if it works towards its maximum potential output, can provide more wealth to its citizens lifting them out of poverty.

          <p>My main aim with this project was finding the indicators of Inequality and find how countries can stay trapped in Poverty.<p>
            <p>I wanted to see whether some countries have escaped poverty, such as China and Ireland.</p>
            <p> A key area that can close the gap is by increasing socioeconomic factors, such as HDI, and dealing with the problem at grassroots by providing more wealth equality.</p>
