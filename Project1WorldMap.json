  "description": "A major issue I encountered during this chart was the severe lack of information on GINI data in most websites worldwide. Even the UNData and WorldBank was lacking a lot of country data per year, I read https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/how-much-do-we-really-know-about-inequality-within-countries-around-the-world/ to understand why this is the case. After doing so, I tried making sure my Data set for 2019 was the most accurate it could be to allow a basepoint for someone to read and reference past dates to, as a result I combined data from multiple sources to allow 2019 to have the most relevant information to allow an observer to reference back on.",
